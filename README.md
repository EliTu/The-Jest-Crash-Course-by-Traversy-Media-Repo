# Jest Crash Course - By Traversy Media 

This is my repository for the [Traversy Media Jest Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r4xVDI2vho) tutorial. This repo contains the code, both the functions and the test code, of the tutorial, as well as a detaild notes file that contains all the explanation about the code, the fucntions, methods and practices used while testing with Jest, as followed by Brad Traversy of Traversy Media.

I made this repo for documenting the study process, as well as to have detailed documentation that I could refer to in the future in case I will need to read again about basic unit testing with Jest. Also, I'm writing the notes to improve my documentation skills and learning methods, as it helps me to reflect on the way I understand the materials passed on from the video.

Lastly, I would like to say big thank you for Brad Traversy from [Traversy Media](http://www.traversymedia.com/) for another wonderful put and explained tutorial! I would defintly recoomand his free & paid tutorials and courses for anyone who's interested in programming.
